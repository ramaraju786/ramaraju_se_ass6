# 🌦️ Quadratic Weather Model with SDLC Approaches 📈  

 📌 Introduction  
This project demonstrates how a **quadratic equation** can be used to model weather patterns 🌍 (specifically temperature variation over time).  

At the same time, it creatively connects the concept of **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** models — **Waterfall, Iterative, and Agile** — by simulating temperature predictions in different development approaches.

🎯 Objectives  
- 🔹 Show how **quadratic functions** can model weather-like data.  
- 🔹 Illustrate the difference between **Waterfall, Iterative, and Agile models** in a fun, practical way.  
- 🔹 Provide students with an easy-to-understand Python program combining **Math + Weather + Software Engineering concepts**.

 📖 Problem Statement  
Predicting weather requires complex systems 🌦️. However, for learning purposes, we can use a **simple quadratic function**:  

We use:
T(t)=at2+bt+c
Where:
T = Temperature (predicted)
t = Time (hour of the day)
a,b,c = Coefficients (based on historical data or assumptions)


⚙️ Functional Requirements  

✅ Calculate quadratic-based temperature for given hours.  
✅ Print predictions for **Waterfall, Iterative, and Agile modes**.  
✅ Allow easy modification of coefficients (`a`, `b`, `c`).
